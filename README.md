# Codewars contributions

This repository gathers some exercises I wrote for codewars.com. Each subdirectory contains the description of the exercise, the tests case to make work, the example tests given to the user, a stub solution provided to the user, a complete solution passing the tests and some utility code that is preloaded before running tests.
